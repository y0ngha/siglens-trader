## Pattern Index (compressed)

Always-on one-line index of **every** chart pattern the engine can detect. Its
job is coverage, not judgement: the model should always know that all 22
patterns exist and be able to **name** any pattern it can clearly see on the
chart, even when that pattern's detailed skill was not injected this run.

The **detailed** judging criteria for a pattern — geometry tolerances,
confirmation nuance, wider invalidation context — arrive in a separate skill
only when the pre-screener flags that specific pattern as a plausible
candidate on the current chart. This index is the cheap always-present
fallback so no visible pattern goes unnamed just because its full guide
wasn't gated in — and each entry below already carries a compact `geom:`
definition (breakoutLevel/extremeLevel/direction/invalidationLevel) so the
`patternSummaries[].geometry` field can always be filled, gated or not.

`type: indicator_guide` is used deliberately (not `type: pattern`): this file is
a cross-cutting always-on reference for the whole pattern category, mirroring
`_core/indicator-core.md`. It is not a single detectable pattern, so it carries
no `pattern:` id and is exempt from `usage_roles` (the always-on exemption).

Each entry's `geom:` line uses this compact notation: `B` = breakoutLevel, `E`
= extremeLevel, `dir` = direction (`up`/`down`), `inv` = invalidationLevel —
the same definitions as that pattern's own gated skill (one source of
wording). Fill `patternSummaries[].geometry` from this line; **never** compute
a measured target, conservative target, or risk/reward yourself — the app
derives 측정 목표가/보수 목표가(50%) from `geometry`.

### Reversal patterns

- **head_and_shoulders:** three peaks, middle (head) highest, neckline break down = bearish reversal. geom: B=neckline@break, E=head, dir=down, inv=right-shoulder high.
- **inverse_head_and_shoulders:** three troughs, middle (head) lowest, neckline break up = bullish reversal. geom: B=neckline@break, E=head, dir=up, inv=right-shoulder low.
- **double_top:** two roughly equal highs (M shape), neckline (intervening low) break down = bearish reversal. geom: B=neckline, E=avg(2 peaks), dir=down, inv=higher peak.
- **double_bottom:** two roughly equal lows (W shape), neckline (intervening high) break up = bullish reversal. geom: B=neckline, E=avg(2 troughs), dir=up, inv=lower trough.
- **triple_top:** three roughly equal highs at resistance, neckline (support) break down = bearish reversal. geom: B=neckline, E=avg(3 peaks), dir=down, inv=highest peak.
- **triple_bottom:** three roughly equal lows at support, neckline (resistance) break up = bullish reversal. geom: B=neckline, E=avg(3 troughs), dir=up, inv=lowest trough.
- **rounding_bottom:** slow U-shaped (saucer) base, gradual momentum shift, break up above the left rim = bullish reversal. geom: B=rim, E=saucer bottom, dir=up, inv=recent right-side trough.
- **rounding_top:** slow inverted-bowl (dome) top after a rise, close below the rim (lowest low in the pattern) = bearish reversal. geom: B=rim (lowest low), E=dome top, dir=down, inv=dome top.

### Continuation patterns

- **ascending_triangle:** flat resistance on top + rising lows, breakout up = bullish continuation. geom: B=horizontal resistance, E=support trendline@start(widest), dir=up, inv=support trendline@last bar.
- **ascending_wedge (rising wedge):** both bounds slope up and converge, break down = bearish (reversal/continuation-against). geom: B=lower trendline@breakdown, E=upper trendline@start(widest), dir=down, inv=upper trendline@last bar.
- **descending_wedge (falling wedge):** both bounds slope down and converge, break up = bullish (reversal/continuation-against). geom: B=upper trendline@breakout, E=lower trendline@start(widest), dir=up, inv=lower trendline@last bar.
- **bull_flag:** sharp rally (pole) then a slight downward-drifting channel, break up = bullish continuation. geom: B=upper channel bound@breakout, E=flagpole start(base), dir=up, inv=lower channel bound.
- **bear_flag:** sharp drop (pole) then a slight upward-drifting channel, break down = bearish continuation. geom: B=lower channel bound@breakdown, E=flagpole start(top), dir=down, inv=upper channel bound.
- **cup_and_handle:** rounded U cup + small pullback handle near the rim, break up = bullish continuation. geom: B=handle resistance, E=cup bottom, dir=up, inv=handle low.
- **high_tight_flag:** pole of +90% or more within ~2 months, then a shallow pause (give-back ≤25%); close above the pole top = bullish continuation. geom: B=pole top, E=pole base, dir=up, inv=flag low.

### Neutral / bilateral patterns

- **descending_triangle:** flat support on bottom + falling highs; near direction-neutral (Bulkowski dt.html: breaks up 53%) — bearish only after a close below support. geom: B=horizontal support, E=resistance trendline@start(widest), dir=down, inv=resistance trendline@last bar.
- **symmetrical_triangle:** lower highs + higher lows converge; neutral until it breaks (Bulkowski: up 60% / down 40%). geom: B=broken trendline@breakout, E=opposite trendline@start(widest), dir=break side, inv=opposite trendline@last bar.
- **pennant:** sharp move (pole) then a small symmetrical triangle; continues in the pole's direction on break. geom: B=pennant trendline@break (upper=bull/lower=bear), E=flagpole start, dir=pole direction, inv=opposite trendline.
- **rectangle:** price oscillates between horizontal support and resistance; direction is decided by which side breaks. geom: B=broken boundary, E=opposite boundary, dir=break side, inv=opposite boundary.
- **ascending_channel:** parallel rising trendlines; up-trend state until a close outside either line (a close below the lower line breaks the up-trend). geom: B=broken trendline@last bar, E=opposite trendline, dir=break side, inv=opposite trendline@last bar.
- **descending_channel:** parallel falling trendlines; down-trend state until a close outside either line (a close above the upper line breaks the down-trend). geom: B=broken trendline@last bar, E=opposite trendline, dir=break side, inv=opposite trendline@last bar.
- **broadening_formation:** higher highs + lower lows (megaphone); neutral until a close outside a line (Bulkowski bt.html/broadb.html: up 60%). geom: B=broken trendline@last bar, E=opposite trendline@last bar(widest), dir=break side, inv=opposite trendline@last bar.

### Reporting directive

- Bulkowski: many chart patterns perform worse than in the 1990s — descending triangles almost in half (thepatternsite.com/dt.html; decade table: thepatternsite.com/TimePerformance.html) — never call a trade on a pattern alone.
- Patterns **not** in the current prompt's detailed set may still be reported if clearly visible — name them and describe the structure. The **reduced confidence** attaches ONLY to the pattern-identification claim itself (its detailed skill's tolerances/nuance were not supplied this run) — it does **not** reduce the confidence of the overall analysis. Everything else — key levels, indicators, strategies, and the action plan — must stay fully committed and quantified.
- Report any pattern you can clearly see, listed by the pre-screener or not; an approximate textbook shape is enough. Fill `patternSummaries[].geometry` from the `geom:` line above (or from the pattern's own gated skill when it was injected). Never compute a measured target, conservative target, or risk/reward yourself — the app derives 측정 목표가/보수 목표가(50%) from `geometry`, so do not leave a named pattern's `geometry` empty.
- **Beyond this catalog:** the 22 patterns above are not an exhaustive list of what you may report — you may also name any other well-established chart pattern you clearly see (e.g. diamond, island reversal), using its standard English name. There is no `geom:` line for these, so derive `geometry` by the generic rule: `breakoutLevel` = the level the pattern breaks through; `extremeLevel` = the pattern's textbook measured-move anchor (its widest point or most extreme price); `direction` = the breakout direction; `invalidationLevel` = the level whose breach negates the pattern. As with every other pattern, never compute a measured target, conservative target, or risk/reward yourself.

<!-- PROMPT_DIGEST:START -->
Pattern Index — one-line index of EVERY detectable chart pattern. Always know all 22 exist and NAME any pattern clearly visible on the chart, even when its detailed skill was not injected. Detailed judging (tolerances, confirmation nuance) arrives separately ONLY for patterns the pre-screener flags as candidates — but every entry below already carries a compact `geom:` line (B=breakoutLevel, E=extremeLevel, dir=direction, inv=invalidationLevel) so `patternSummaries[].geometry` can always be filled.

Directive: patterns NOT in this prompt's detailed set may still be reported if clearly visible — name and describe them, but the REDUCED confidence attaches ONLY to the pattern-identification claim (detailed nuance not supplied this run), NOT to the overall analysis. Key levels, indicators, strategies, and action plan stay fully committed and quantified. Report any pattern you can clearly see, listed by the pre-screener or not; an approximate textbook shape is enough. Fill `geometry` from the `geom:` line above; never compute targets — the app derives 측정 목표가/보수 목표가(50%) from `geometry`.
Evidence: Bulkowski — many patterns perform worse than in the 1990s (descending triangles almost half, thepatternsite.com/dt.html); never call a trade on a pattern alone.
Beyond this catalog: the 22 above are not exhaustive — also name any other well-established chart pattern you clearly see (e.g. diamond, island reversal) by its standard English name. No `geom:` line exists for these — derive geometry by the generic rule: breakoutLevel = level the pattern breaks through; extremeLevel = its textbook measured-move anchor (widest/most extreme point); direction = breakout direction; invalidationLevel = level whose breach negates the pattern. Never compute a target or R:R yourself.
