## Overview

The Mean Reversion Strategy is based on the statistical tendency of prices to return to their mean (average) after deviating significantly. When price moves too far from its average — measured by standard deviations, oscillator extremes, or band violations — the probability of a reversal back toward the mean increases.

This is one of the most academically validated strategies in quantitative finance, with documented effectiveness across equities, commodities, and forex markets, particularly in range-bound environments (win rate 60-70% in sideways markets).

The strategy works best when the market is **not trending strongly** (ADX < 25). In trending markets, mean reversion signals produce losing trades (catching falling knives or shorting into strength).

---

## Core Principle

Price oscillates around a moving average or equilibrium level. Extreme deviations from this level are unsustainable and tend to correct:

- **Oversold (extreme below mean)**: Price has fallen too far, too fast → high probability of bounce back toward mean
- **Overbought (extreme above mean)**: Price has risen too far, too fast → high probability of pullback toward mean

The "mean" can be defined as:
1. A moving average (MA20, MA50)
2. The middle Bollinger Band (MA20)
3. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
4. A statistical mean over a defined lookback period

## Signal Indicators

### Bollinger Bands

The primary mean reversion tool. Bollinger Bands (20-period MA ± 2 standard deviations) contain approximately 95% of price action.

| Condition | Signal | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Price touches/penetrates lower band | Oversold | Buy signal — price at statistical extreme below mean |
| Price touches/penetrates upper band | Overbought | Sell signal — price at statistical extreme above mean |
| Price at middle band (MA20) | Mean | Target — expected reversion destination |
| Band width contracting (squeeze) | Low volatility | Caution — breakout likely, mean reversion may fail |
| Band width expanding | High volatility | Extreme moves may continue before reverting |

**Bollinger Band %B**:
- %B = (Price − Lower Band) / (Upper Band − Lower Band)
- %B < 0: Price below lower band (extreme oversold)
- %B > 1: Price above upper band (extreme overbought)
- %B = 0.5: Price at middle band (mean)

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

| Condition | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| RSI < 30 | Oversold | Buy signal — selling momentum exhausted |
| RSI < 20 | Extremely oversold | Strong buy signal — extreme deviation |
| RSI > 70 | Overbought | Sell signal — buying momentum exhausted |
| RSI > 80 | Extremely overbought | Strong sell signal — extreme deviation |
| RSI crossing 50 from below | Bullish mean cross | Mean confirmed — upward reversion in progress |
| RSI crossing 50 from above | Bearish mean cross | Mean confirmed — downward reversion in progress |

### Moving Average Deviation

When price deviates more than 2 standard deviations from a key moving average, mean reversion probability increases:

- Distance from MA = (Current Price − MA) / MA × 100
- Deviation > +10% from MA → overbought
- Deviation < −10% from MA → oversold
- Adjust thresholds based on the asset's historical volatility

## Entry Rules

### Mean Reversion Buy (Oversold)

**Standard Entry**:
1. **Environment check**: ADX < 25 (non-trending or weakly trending market)
2. **Primary signal**: Price touches or penetrates the lower Bollinger Band
3. **Confirmation**: RSI < 30 simultaneously (dual-indicator oversold)
4. **Entry trigger**: Enter long when a bullish reversal candle forms (hammer, bullish engulfing, or any candle that closes in the upper half of its range)
5. **Stop loss**: Below the lowest point of the oversold move, or 2 × ATR below entry
6. **Target**: Middle Bollinger Band (MA20) for primary target; upper Bollinger Band for aggressive target

**High-Confidence Entry** (3 conditions simultaneously):
1. Price below lower Bollinger Band (%B < 0)
2. RSI < 30
3. Price at or near a known support level (horizontal support, prior swing low, or Fibonacci level)
→ This triple confluence produces the highest win rate for mean reversion entries

### Mean Reversion Sell (Overbought)

**Standard Entry**:
1. **Environment check**: ADX < 25
2. **Primary signal**: Price touches or penetrates the upper Bollinger Band
3. **Confirmation**: RSI > 70 simultaneously
4. **Entry trigger**: Enter short when a bearish reversal candle forms (shooting star, bearish engulfing, or any candle that closes in the lower half of its range)
5. **Stop loss**: Above the highest point of the overbought move, or 2 × ATR above entry
6. **Target**: Middle Bollinger Band (MA20) for primary target; lower Bollinger Band for aggressive target

---

## Exit Rules

- **Primary target**: Middle Bollinger Band (MA20) — this is the "mean" in mean reversion
- **Extended target**: Opposite Bollinger Band — only when initial move back to mean shows strong momentum
- **Stop loss**: 2 × ATR beyond the extreme point of the deviation
- **Time-based exit**: If price fails to begin reverting within 5-7 bars, the oversold/overbought condition may be part of a trend rather than a deviation — close position
- **Invalidation**: If RSI reaches even more extreme levels (e.g., entered at RSI 28, RSI drops to 15) without price stabilizing, the setup may be failing — tighten stop or exit

---

## Environment Filter: ADX

The ADX (Average Directional Index) is critical for filtering mean reversion signals:

| ADX Value | Market Environment | Mean Reversion Suitability |
|---|---|---|
| < 15 | No trend, very low volatility | Good — but small moves, tight targets |
| 15-25 | Weak trend or range-bound | Best environment for mean reversion |
| 25-35 | Moderate trend developing | Caution — mean reversion works but with higher risk |
| > 35 | Strong trend | Avoid mean reversion — use trend-following instead |
| > 50 | Extreme trend | Do not use mean reversion — high risk of continued deviation |

## Confidence Weight Rationale

confidence_weight: 0.74 — Mean reversion is one of the most academically documented market phenomena, with robust statistical evidence across asset classes. In range-bound markets, the strategy has documented win rates of 60–70%, clear mathematical foundation (deviation from mean), and well-defined entry/exit criteria. The 0.74 weight sits slightly above breakout (0.72) on the strength of this statistical backing, while acknowledging that the critical dependency on market environment (ranging vs. trending) and the risk of catching falling knives in trending markets prevent a higher rating.

Factors that increase confidence:
- ADX < 25 confirms non-trending environment
- Multiple indicators simultaneously confirm oversold/overbought (Bollinger + RSI)
- Price is at a known support/resistance level (triple confluence)
- Volume decreases during the extreme move (exhaustion)
- Higher timeframe shows no clear trend (sideways)

Factors that decrease confidence:
- ADX > 30 (trending market — mean reversion is counter-trend)
- Only one indicator shows oversold/overbought (single signal)
- Fundamental catalyst driving the move (earnings, news) — may not revert
- Price has been trending strongly on the higher timeframe
- Bollinger Bands expanding rapidly (increasing volatility)

---

## Limitations and Caveats

- **Catching falling knives**: The most dangerous failure mode. In a strong downtrend, price can remain "oversold" for days or weeks, producing repeated losing buy signals. Always check the higher timeframe trend and ADX before entering
- **Not for trending markets**: Mean reversion is fundamentally a range-bound strategy. Applying it in trending markets leads to systematic losses. The ADX filter is not optional — it is essential
- **News-driven moves**: Fundamental catalysts (earnings surprises, regulatory changes, macro events) can cause permanent price shifts, not temporary deviations. Mean reversion does not apply to fundamental re-pricing
- **Band expansion trap**: When Bollinger Bands are expanding (increasing volatility), touching the lower band may be the start of a larger move, not an extreme. Look for band contraction or stabilization before entering
- **Asymmetric risk**: Mean reversion targets (back to the mean) are typically smaller than potential losses (deviation continues). Strict stop losses and position sizing are essential to survive the losing trades

Additional output rules:
- If **ADX > 30**, explicitly warn that mean reversion signals are unreliable in the current trending environment
- If **Bollinger + RSI** both confirm oversold/overbought simultaneously, flag as high-confidence signal
- If price is at a **known support/resistance level** while oversold/overbought, flag as triple confluence (highest confidence)
- If neither oversold nor overbought conditions exist, state "현재 과매수/과매도 조건 미충족 — 평균 회귀 신호 없음"
- Set the `trend` field: `bullish` if oversold conditions confirmed in non-trending market, `bearish` if overbought conditions confirmed in non-trending market, `neutral` if no mean reversion signal or trending environment

평균 회귀 전략 (confidence_weight 0.74)
Price returns to mean after significant deviation. Win rate 60-70% in range-bound markets. Works best when NOT trending strongly (ADX<25); in trending markets produces losing trades (falling knives / shorting strength).
Mean = MA20/MA50, middle Bollinger Band (MA20), VWAP, or statistical mean. Oversold (extreme below) → bounce likely; Overbought (extreme above) → pullback likely.

### Signal indicators
Bollinger Bands (20-MA ± 2 SD, ~95% of price action):
- touches/penetrates lower band = oversold buy; upper band = overbought sell; middle (MA20) = mean/target; width contracting (squeeze) = low vol, breakout likely, reversion may fail; width expanding = extreme moves may continue before reverting.
- %B = (Price − Lower)/(Upper − Lower); %B<0 = below lower (extreme oversold); %B>1 = above upper (extreme overbought); %B=0.5 = middle (mean).
RSI: <30 oversold buy; <20 extremely oversold strong buy; >70 overbought sell; >80 extremely overbought strong sell; crossing 50 from below = bullish mean cross (upward reversion in progress); from above = bearish mean cross.
MA deviation: Distance = (Price − MA)/MA ×100; >+10% = overbought; <−10% = oversold; adjust by historical volatility.

### Entry
Buy (oversold) standard: (1) ADX<25; (2) price touches/penetrates lower Bollinger; (3) RSI<30 simultaneously; (4) enter long on bullish reversal candle (hammer, bullish engulfing, or close in upper half of range); (5) stop below lowest point of move or 2×ATR below entry; (6) target middle band (MA20), aggressive = upper band.
Buy high-confidence (3 simultaneous): %B<0 + RSI<30 + at/near known support (horizontal, prior swing low, Fibonacci) → triple confluence, highest win rate.
Sell (overbought) standard: (1) ADX<25; (2) price touches/penetrates upper band; (3) RSI>70 simultaneously; (4) enter short on bearish reversal candle (shooting star, bearish engulfing, or close in lower half); (5) stop above highest point or 2×ATR above; (6) target middle band, aggressive = lower band.

### Exit
Primary target: middle band (MA20). Extended: opposite band, only when initial move to mean shows strong momentum. Stop: 2×ATR beyond deviation extreme. Time: if no reversion within 5-7 bars, condition may be trend not deviation — close. Invalidation: if RSI reaches even more extreme (e.g. entered RSI 28, drops to 15) without price stabilizing — tighten stop or exit.

### Environment Filter: ADX (essential, NOT optional)
<15 no trend/very low vol → good but small moves, tight targets; 15-25 weak trend/range → BEST for mean reversion; 25-35 moderate trend developing → caution, higher risk; >35 strong trend → AVOID, use trend-following; >50 extreme trend → do NOT use, high risk of continued deviation.

### Confidence
Increase: ADX<25; Bollinger+RSI both confirm; at known S/R (triple confluence); volume decreases during extreme (exhaustion); higher TF no clear trend.
Decrease: ADX>30 (counter-trend); only one indicator; fundamental catalyst (earnings/news) — may not revert; strong higher-TF trend; Bollinger bands expanding rapidly.
Caveats: catching falling knives (price stays oversold days/weeks in strong downtrend) — always check higher-TF trend + ADX. Not for trending markets — ADX filter essential. News-driven moves = permanent re-pricing, not deviation. Band-expansion trap: lower-band touch during expanding bands may start larger move — wait for contraction/stabilization. Asymmetric risk: reversion targets smaller than potential losses — strict stops + sizing essential.

### Output (one **label**: value per line)
**시장 환경**: [ADX 기반, 예: ADX 18 — 비추세, 적합 / ADX 38 — 강한 추세, 부적합]
**볼린저 밴드 위치**: [예: 하단 밴드 터치 (%B=-0.05) — 극단 과매도]
**RSI 상태**: [값+해석, 예: RSI 25 — 과매도, 매수 신호 활성]
**이평선 이격도**: [예: MA20 대비 -8.2% 이격 — 과매도 근접]
**매매 신호**: [종합, 예: 볼린저 하단 + RSI 28 = 이중 과매도 — 반등 매수 적합 / 조건 미충족]
**상세 분석**: [환경 적합성, 복합 지표, S/R 수렴, 목표가(중심 밴드), 리스크, 주의사항]
- If ADX>30, explicitly warn signals unreliable in trending environment.
- If Bollinger+RSI both confirm → flag high-confidence.
- If at known S/R while oversold/overbought → flag triple confluence (highest).
- If neither condition → "현재 과매수/과매도 조건 미충족 — 평균 회귀 신호 없음".
- trend: bullish if oversold confirmed in non-trending, bearish if overbought confirmed in non-trending, neutral if no signal or trending.
