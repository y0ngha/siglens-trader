## Detection Criteria

- Two distinct troughs must form at approximately the same price level, within 3% of each other.
- A clear peak (neckline) must exist between the two troughs, with a height of at least 3% from the trough average.
- The two troughs must be separated by a minimum of 10 bars to distinguish the pattern from short-term noise.
- The closer the two trough prices are to each other, the higher the pattern reliability.
- The pattern is confirmed when price closes above the neckline (the peak between the two troughs).

## Confidence Weight Rationale

confidence_weight: 0.75 — Double Bottom is the bullish mirror of the Double Top pattern and carries the same confidence level. Its two-trough structure is simpler than the three-point Head and Shoulders, making it slightly more susceptible to false signals. However, with volume confirmation and a decisive neckline break, it is a well-established bullish reversal pattern.

Factors that increase confidence:
- Trough prices within 1% of each other
- Clear volume increase on second trough
- Neckline break with volume surge
- Sufficient spacing between troughs (> 15 bars)

Factors that decrease confidence:
- Trough prices differing by more than 2.5%
- No volume divergence between troughs
- Shallow peak between troughs (< 3% from trough average)
- Pattern forming in a narrow trading range

## Key Signals

- **Second trough volume increase**: Volume on the second trough should be higher than on the first trough, or show a notable uptick. This indicates accumulation and growing buying interest at the support level.
- **Neckline break with volume**: A close above the neckline accompanied by increased volume confirms the bullish reversal. Low-volume breaks are less reliable.
- **RSI divergence**: If RSI makes a higher low on the second trough while price reaches the same level, this bullish divergence reinforces the pattern.
- **Successful retest**: After the neckline break, a pullback that holds above the neckline level strengthens the bullish case.

## False Positive Conditions

- **Downtrend continuation**: In a strong downtrend, two troughs at similar levels may simply represent a pause before further decline. Examine the broader trend context.
- **Troughs too close together (< 10 bars)**: When troughs form within a very short timeframe, the pattern may just be intraday volatility rather than a structural reversal signal.
- **No volume divergence**: If the second trough shows equal or lower volume than the first, there is no evidence of accumulation and the reversal signal is weak.
- **Shallow peak**: If the peak between troughs is less than 3% of the trough price, there is insufficient buying pressure to constitute a valid neckline.
- **Premature neckline break**: An intraday wick above the neckline without a closing break is not confirmation.

## Entry/Exit Considerations

- **Target price calculation**: Measure the vertical distance from the neckline to the average of the two troughs. Project this distance upward from the neckline break point. Example: if troughs average $80 and neckline is at $85, the target is $90 ($85 + $5).
- **Risk/reward assessment**: The distance from current price to target versus the distance from current price to the second trough low defines the risk/reward ratio. A ratio of at least 2:1 is analytically favorable.
- **Stop-loss reference level**: The lower of the two troughs serves as the invalidation level. A close below this level negates the bullish pattern.
- **Partial target**: 50% of the full projected distance serves as a conservative initial target.
- **Time symmetry**: Patterns where the two troughs are roughly equidistant in time from the neckline tend to be more reliable.

Note: These are analytical reference points for technical analysis, not trading recommendations.

## AI Analysis Instructions

When this pattern is detected, include the following in the analysis response:

- **keyPrices**: Include both trough prices, the neckline price level, and the projected target price if the neckline is broken.
- **patternSummaries**: Describe the pattern status (first trough formed / second trough in progress / completed / neckline broken), the price difference percentage between the two troughs, and spacing between them.
- **Volume context**: State whether volume behavior confirms the pattern (increasing volume on second trough, volume increase on neckline break).
- **Completion status**: Clearly indicate whether the pattern is still forming (second trough in progress) or fully confirmed by a neckline break.
- **Target projection**: Calculate and state the measured move target using neckline-to-trough distance projected above the neckline.

### Double Bottom (bullish reversal)

Geometry:
- Two distinct troughs at ~same price, within 3% of each other (closer = more reliable).
- Clear peak (neckline) between troughs, height ≥3% from trough average.
- Troughs separated by minimum 10 bars.
- Confirmed: close ABOVE neckline (the peak between troughs).

Confidence (weight 0.75): bullish mirror of Double Top.
- Increase: trough prices within 1%, volume increase on second trough, neckline break with volume surge, spacing > 15 bars.
- Decrease: troughs differ > 2.5%, no volume divergence, shallow peak (< 3% from trough avg), pattern in narrow range.

Signals: second-trough volume HIGHER than first (accumulation); neckline break with volume; RSI higher low on second trough = bullish divergence; successful retest holds above neckline.

False positives / invalidation:
- Strong downtrend: two troughs may be a pause before further decline — check trend context.
- Troughs < 10 bars apart = intraday noise.
- No volume divergence (2nd trough equal/lower volume) = weak.
- Peak < 3% of trough price = invalid neckline.
- Intraday wick above neckline without close = not confirmed.

Target: vertical distance neckline − average of two troughs; project UP from neckline break point (e.g., troughs avg $80, neckline $85 → target $90). Partial = 50% of projected distance.
Stop/invalidation: the LOWER of the two troughs; close below negates. R/R ≥ 2:1 favorable. Time-symmetric troughs (equidistant from neckline) more reliable.

Output:
- keyPrices: both trough prices, neckline price, projected target (if broken).
- patternSummaries: status (first trough formed / second trough in progress / completed / neckline broken), price difference % between troughs, spacing.
- Volume context: increasing on second trough, increase on neckline break.
- Completion status: forming (second trough in progress) vs confirmed (neckline break).
- Target projection: neckline-to-trough distance projected above neckline.
- Include analytical-reference (not trading-recommendation) framing.
