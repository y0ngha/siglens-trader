## Evidence and Reliability

Elliott Wave counts are subjective: two competent analysts can count the same chart differently, and a count is often clear only in hindsight. Batchelor & Ramyar ("Magic numbers in the Dow", 2006) found no Fibonacci clustering in Dow trend ratios beyond chance.

confidence_weight: 0.4 — use Elliott as a structural vocabulary, not a forecast. Every count must come with an alternate count and an invalidation price.

## Absolute Rules (Frost & Prechter, *Elliott Wave Principle*)

Any count that violates one of these is invalid — discard it and recount:

1. **Wave 2** never retraces more than 100% of Wave 1.
2. **Wave 3** is never the shortest of Waves 1, 3 and 5.
3. **Wave 4** never enters the price territory of Wave 1. Exception: diagonals only.

## Wave Characteristics

- **W1**: often mistaken for a bounce inside a downtrend.
- **W3**: typically the longest and strongest; breaks the W1 extreme on expanding volume.
- **W5**: in stocks usually weaker momentum than W3 (divergence is common); may extend or truncate.
- **A**: often read as an ordinary pullback. **B**: a false recovery, usually on lighter volume; can exceed the prior extreme in an expanded flat. **C**: the decisive, impulsive leg.

## Motive Waves

- **Impulse** 5-3-5-3-5: W3 is always an impulse; W2 is never a lone triangle. Usually only one of W1/W3/W5 extends — most often W3.
- **Leading diagonal** (W1 or A): 5-3-5-3-5; W4 overlaps W1.
- **Ending diagonal** (W5 or C): 3-3-3-3-3; W4 overlaps W1; momentum fades; usually followed by a sharp reversal.
- Contracting diagonal = converging trendlines, each motive leg shorter; expanding = diverging, each leg longer.

## Corrective Waves

- **Zigzag** 5-3-5: B does not retrace beyond the start of A; C usually ends beyond the end of A.
- **Flat** 3-3-5: B ends near the start of A (regular), beyond it with C ending beyond A (expanded), or beyond it with C falling short of A (running).
- **Triangle** 3-3-3-3-3 (A-B-C-D-E): only in W4, in wave B, or as the final leg of a combination; contracting, or rarely expanding; a thrust follows completion.
- **Combinations** — double three (W-X-Y) and triple three (W-X-Y-X-Z) join simple corrections with X waves; a triangle appears only as the final leg.

## Alternation

W2 and W4 tend to differ in form: if one is sharp (zigzag), the other tends to be sideways (flat, triangle, combination). W2 is usually the deeper retracement.

## Truncation

A truncated fifth (or C) fails to move beyond the end of W3 (or A), typically after an unusually strong W3. It still subdivides into five waves — an impulse or an ending diagonal. Treat it as confirmed only once price breaks back through the end of W4 (or B); before that, report it as a suspicion.

## Fibonacci Ratios

Ratio reference only — e.g. W2 commonly 50–61.8% of W1, W4 commonly 38.2% of W3, W5 commonly equal to W1. Per Batchelor & Ramyar these ratios do not occur more often than chance, so a ratio is never grounds for a price by itself. A numeric price is valid only when that ratio is listed in `## Market Reference` (nearest-list row or that horizon's `Fib table:` / `Fib ABC table:` line) — never compute one.

## AI Analysis Instructions

Use the **last 120 bars maximum**. Count only the **most recent** identifiable structure at the end of the data — do not label the whole history. Apply the three absolute rules strictly.

**Wave-ratio targets (mandatory rule)**: a numeric target or retracement is valid only when the matching ratio appears as a `Fib N%` / `Fib ext N%` / `Fib ABC ext N%` row, or in that horizon's `Fib table:` / `Fib ABC table:` line, in `## Market Reference` for the relevant swing — cite that price. Never compute a price from a ratio. Every standard ratio (23.6/38.2/50/61.8/78.6/100/127.2/161.8/200/261.8%) is always available one of those two ways; only a non-standard ratio (76.4%, 85.4%) may be absent — then describe the zone qualitatively without a number.

**Invalidation price**: name the price that breaks the primary count under the rules above (e.g. W1 start for a W2 count, W1 extreme for a W4 count). Use only a price present in `## Market Reference` or in the bar data — never a computed one.

Additional output rules:
- Corrective wave in progress → cite retracement levels only from listed `Fib N%` rows or that horizon's `Fib table:` line. Motive wave in progress → cite extensions only from listed `Fib ext N%` / `Fib ABC ext N%` rows or the `Fib table:` / `Fib ABC table:` line.
- Set the `trend` field: `bullish` if in a motive (impulse/extension) wave, `bearish` if in a corrective wave, `neutral` if unclear or consolidating.

엘리어트 파동 (confidence_weight 0.4)
Evidence: Batchelor & Ramyar (2006) found no Fibonacci clustering in Dow trend ratios beyond chance; counts are subjective — always give an alternate count.

Rules (violation = invalid count): (1) W2 never retraces >100% of W1. (2) W3 never the shortest of W1/W3/W5. (3) W4 never enters W1 price territory — exception: diagonals only.
Impulse 5-3-5-3-5, W3 always impulse, usually one motive wave extends (most often W3). Leading diagonal (W1/A) 5-3-5-3-5; ending diagonal (W5/C) 3-3-3-3-3.
Corrections: zigzag 5-3-5 (B stays within A's start, C usually beyond A's end); flat 3-3-5 (B near/beyond A's start); triangle 3-3-3-3-3 only in W4, B, or last leg of a combination (WXY/WXYXZ). W2/W4 alternate sharp vs sideways.
Truncation: W5 (or C) fails to pass W3 (or A) end, usually after a strong W3; still subdivides into five (impulse or ending diagonal). Confirmed only when price breaks the W4 (or B) end.
Ratios are reference only: a numeric target/retracement must be a Market Reference `Fib N%`/`Fib ext N%`/`Fib ABC ext N%` row or that horizon's `Fib table:`/`Fib ABC table:` line — cite it, never compute. Standard ratios always exist; a missing non-standard one (76.4/85.4%) → qualitative only.
