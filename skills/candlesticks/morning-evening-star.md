## Overview

Morning Star / Evening Star are 3-candle reversal patterns with higher reliability than single-candle patterns.
When the middle candle is a Doji, the pattern is classified as a Morning/Evening Doji Star and carries even greater reliability.

### Morning Star
1. Long bearish candle (downtrend continuation)
2. Small-body candle (gap down, indecision)
3. Long bullish candle (recovers at least 50% of the first candle)

### Evening Star
1. Long bullish candle (uptrend continuation)
2. Small-body candle (gap up, indecision)
3. Long bearish candle (retraces at least 50% of the first candle)

## Signal Interpretation

### Morning Star
- **Strong signal**: Clear downtrend + middle candle is a Doji + third candle recovers ≥ 60% of the first candle + increased volume
- **Moderate signal**: Appears after a downtrend, third candle recovers 50–60%
- **Weak signal**: Trend unclear, third candle recovery ratio below 50%

### Evening Star
- **Strong signal**: Clear uptrend + middle candle is a Doji + third candle retraces ≥ 60% of the first candle + increased volume
- **Moderate signal**: Appears after an uptrend, third candle retraces 50–60%
- **Weak signal**: Trend unclear, third candle retracement ratio below 50%

## Key Combinations

- **RSI + Star**: Appearing alongside RSI extremes (overbought/oversold) significantly increases reversal reliability
- **MACD + Star**: Appearing simultaneously with a MACD histogram direction change is a powerful signal
- **Volume + Star**: A sharp increase in volume on the third candle confirms the strength of the emerging trend
- **Support/Resistance + Star**: Appearing near key support/resistance levels increases reversal probability

## Caveats

- In 24-hour markets (crypto, FX), gaps rarely form — gap conditions should be relaxed when interpreting the pattern
- If the middle candle's body is too large, the pattern should be classified as a general reversal pattern rather than a Star pattern
- On short-term timeframes (1Min, 5Min), noise is high and reliability is low
- If all three candles have below-average volume, pattern reliability drops sharply

## AI Analysis Instructions

When a Morning Star, Evening Star, Morning Doji Star, or Evening Doji Star is detected:

- Verify the preceding trend using EMA(20) and EMA(60) direction
- Evaluate the third candle's recovery/retracement ratio relative to the first candle
- Check if the middle candle is a Doji variant for enhanced reliability
- Cross-reference with volume changes across all three candles
- For 24-hour markets (crypto, FX), note that gap conditions are naturally relaxed
- State the specific variant detected: "Morning Doji Star has higher reliability than a standard Morning Star"
