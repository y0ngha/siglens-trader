## Detection Criteria

- Three distinct troughs must form at approximately the same price level, within 2-3% of each other.
- Two clear peaks must exist between the three troughs, forming a neckline when connected.
- Each trough must be separated by a meaningful rally (at least 3% from the trough average to the neckline).
- The three troughs must span a minimum of 20 bars to ensure structural validity — Triple Bottom requires more time to form than Double Bottom.
- The closer the three trough prices are to each other, the higher the pattern reliability.
- The pattern is confirmed when price closes above the neckline (the line connecting the two peaks between troughs).

## Confidence Weight Rationale

confidence_weight: 0.78 — Triple Bottom is among the more reliable bullish reversal patterns. Bulkowski reports an 80–85% success rate for upside targets once the neckline breaks. The weight sits slightly below Triple Top (0.8) because bottoming patterns generally take longer to confirm and volume patterns at bottoms are less distinct, but the three-trough structure still provides stronger confirmation than a Double Bottom — three successful defenses of support demonstrate persistent accumulation.

Factors that increase confidence:
- All three trough prices within 1.5% of each other
- Volume decreasing on the third trough compared to the first
- Volume surge on neckline break
- Pattern duration > 30 bars
- RSI or MACD showing bullish divergence across the three troughs

Factors that decrease confidence:
- Trough prices differing by more than 3%
- No volume pattern across troughs
- Shallow peaks between troughs (< 3% from trough average)
- Pattern forming in a strong downtrend with no sign of stabilization
- Third trough notably deeper than the first two (may indicate accelerating downtrend)

## Key Signals

- **Volume decline on third trough**: Ideally, volume decreases on each successive trough, indicating selling pressure is exhausting. The third trough with the lowest volume shows sellers have been absorbed.
- **Neckline break with volume surge**: A close above the neckline accompanied by increased volume confirms the bullish reversal. The neckline connects the two peaks between the three troughs.
- **RSI divergence**: If RSI makes progressively higher lows across the three troughs while price remains at similar levels, this triple bullish divergence is a powerful confirmation of accumulation.
- **Successful retest**: After the neckline break, a pullback that holds above the neckline level strengthens the bullish case and provides a second entry reference point.
- **Third trough strength**: The third trough bouncing more quickly than previous troughs indicates growing buyer confidence.

## False Positive Conditions

- **Downtrend continuation**: In a strong downtrend, three troughs at similar levels may represent a temporary pause before further decline. Examine the broader trend context and fundamental backdrop.
- **No volume patterns**: If volume shows no discernible pattern across the three troughs, the accumulation thesis is weaker and the reversal may not materialize.
- **Insufficient time between troughs**: If the three troughs form too quickly (< 20 bars total), the structure may be noise rather than meaningful accumulation.
- **Descending troughs**: If each successive trough is notably lower than the previous one (> 3%), this is a descending channel, not a Triple Bottom.
- **Premature neckline break**: An intraday wick above the neckline without a closing break is not confirmation.
- **Confusion with Inverse Head and Shoulders**: If the middle trough is significantly lower than the other two, the pattern is Inverse Head and Shoulders, not Triple Bottom.

## Entry/Exit Considerations

- **Target price calculation**: Measure the vertical distance from the neckline to the average of the three troughs. Project this distance upward from the neckline break point. Example: if neckline is at $57 and troughs average $50, the target is $64 ($57 + $7).
- **Risk/reward assessment**: The distance from current price to target versus the distance from current price to the lowest trough defines the risk/reward ratio. A ratio of at least 2:1 is analytically favorable.
- **Stop-loss reference level**: The lowest of the three troughs serves as the invalidation level. A close below this level negates the bullish pattern.
- **Partial target**: 50% of the full projected distance serves as a conservative initial target.
- **Time factor**: Triple Bottoms that take longer to form (> 40 bars) tend to produce larger moves due to greater accumulation.

Note: These are analytical reference points for technical analysis, not trading recommendations.

## AI Analysis Instructions

When this pattern is detected, include the following in the analysis response:

- **keyPrices**: Include all three trough prices, the neckline price level (connecting the two peaks), and the projected target price if the neckline is broken.
- **patternSummaries**: Describe the pattern status (first/second/third trough formed / completed / neckline broken), the price difference percentage among the three troughs, the spacing between them, and how it differs from Double Bottom or Inverse Head and Shoulders.
- **Volume context**: State whether volume behavior confirms the pattern (declining volume across troughs, volume surge on neckline break). Note volume comparison between each successive trough.
- **Completion status**: Clearly indicate whether the pattern is still forming (which trough is in progress) or fully confirmed by a neckline break.
- **Target projection**: Calculate and state the measured move target using neckline-to-trough distance projected above the neckline.
