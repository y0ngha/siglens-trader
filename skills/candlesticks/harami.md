## Overview

Harami is a 2-candle reversal pattern — the opposite structure of Engulfing.
The second candle is completely contained within the body of the first candle, signaling trend weakness and the potential for a reversal.
Reliability is lower than Engulfing, but increases significantly when appearing after a long-term trend.

### Bullish Harami
- A small bullish candle contained within the previous bearish candle's body
- Signals weakening of the downtrend

### Bearish Harami
- A small bearish candle contained within the previous bullish candle's body
- Signals weakening of the uptrend

### Harami Cross
- The second candle is a Doji — a stronger reversal signal
- Simultaneously indicates indecision and the potential for a trend reversal

## Signal Interpretation

### Bullish Harami
- **Strong signal**: Appears after a long downtrend + Harami Cross (second candle is a Doji) + declining volume pattern
- **Moderate signal**: Appears after a downtrend, second candle is within 25% of the first candle's body size
- **Weak signal**: Appears after a short-term decline or trend is unclear

### Bearish Harami
- **Strong signal**: Appears after a long uptrend + Harami Cross + declining volume pattern
- **Moderate signal**: Appears after an uptrend, second candle is within 25% of the first candle's body size
- **Weak signal**: Appears after a short-term rise or trend is unclear

## Key Combinations

- **RSI + Harami**: Appearance in overbought/oversold zones increases reversal probability
- **MACD + Harami**: Harami appearing while the MACD histogram is shrinking confirms trend weakening
- **Bollinger Band + Harami**: Appearance at band extremes alongside band contraction suggests a potential directional shift
- **Volume + Harami**: Declining volume on the second candle provides additional confirmation of trend weakening

## Caveats

- Lower reliability than Engulfing — interpret alongside a confirmation candle rather than in isolation
- If the second candle extends beyond the first candle's body, it is not a Harami
- Reliability drops sharply when the trend is short or unclear
- A Harami with high volume can instead signal trend continuation

## AI Analysis Instructions

When a Bullish Harami, Bearish Harami, or Harami Cross is detected:

- Evaluate the length and strength of the preceding trend using EMA(20/60) and ADX
- Determine if the pattern is a standard Harami or a Harami Cross (Doji variant) for confidence adjustment
- Check the volume pattern: declining volume on the second candle confirms the interpretation
- Cross-reference with RSI and MACD momentum indicators
- Note the relative confidence: "Harami has lower reliability than Engulfing — a confirmation candle is required"
- For Harami Cross, emphasize the enhanced reliability: "Harami Cross is a stronger reversal signal than a standard Harami"
