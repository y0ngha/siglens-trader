## Overview

CCI (Commodity Channel Index) measures the deviation of the Typical Price (TP = (high + low + close) / 3) from its simple moving average, normalized by the mean absolute deviation and a scaling constant of 0.015. Unlike RSI or Stochastic, CCI has no fixed bounds — values can extend well beyond ±100 or even ±200 during extreme price movements. The standard setting uses a 20-period window.

## Signal Interpretation

### Primary Thresholds

- CCI > +100: price has moved significantly above its statistical average — potential overbought condition or the beginning of a strong trend. Sustained values above +100 indicate an uptrend in progress, not necessarily a sell signal.
- CCI < -100: price is significantly below its statistical average — potential oversold condition or a strong downtrend. Sustained negative values below -100 indicate a downtrend in progress.
- CCI crossing above -100 from below: a buy signal — downside momentum is weakening and price is returning toward fair value.
- CCI crossing below +100 from above: a sell signal — upside momentum is fading.

### Zero-Line Crossover

- CCI crossing above 0 from below: an early bullish momentum shift signal. Useful as a direction filter to confirm the overall trend has turned positive.
- CCI crossing below 0 from above: an early bearish momentum shift.

### Trend Persistence Signals

- CCI consistently above +100 for multiple bars: a strong uptrend is in progress. In this environment, pullbacks toward the +100 level are buying opportunities rather than sell signals.
- CCI consistently below -100 for multiple bars: a strong downtrend is in progress.
- Lower highs in CCI while price makes higher highs (bearish divergence): upside momentum is weakening — potential reversal.
- Higher lows in CCI while price makes lower lows (bullish divergence): downside momentum is weakening — potential recovery.

### Extreme CCI Readings

- CCI > +200: very rare condition indicating extreme upside deviation from the mean. Historical pattern: price tends to eventually revert, though the timing is unpredictable.
- CCI < -200: extreme downside deviation. May signal a climax move or panic selling.

## Key Combinations

- CCI + RSI: Both are oscillators measuring different aspects of momentum. When both simultaneously signal overbought or oversold, the confluence strengthens the signal.
- CCI + Bollinger Bands: CCI > +100 while price is near the Bollinger upper band = strong confluence for overbought; CCI < -100 near lower band = strong confluence for oversold.
- CCI + MACD: CCI zero-line crossover in the same direction as MACD crossover provides early confirmation of a trend shift.
- CCI + Volume: CCI extreme readings combined with volume spikes often mark price reversals. Volume surge at CCI > +200 may signal climax buying.

## Caveats

- CCI has no fixed upper or lower bounds. Do not set mechanical hard limits for overbought/oversold — context determines interpretation.
- In trending markets, CCI values above +100 indicate trend strength and should not trigger automatic sell signals without additional context.
- CCI is sensitive to the 0.015 normalization constant. While this constant standardizes the distribution, real-world readings frequently exceed ±300 during gap moves or earnings events.
- Shorter CCI periods (10–14) respond faster but generate more noise; longer periods (25–50) smooth the signal but lag more.

### CCI Signal Guide
- Period 20; Typical Price = (high+low+close)/3; no fixed bounds — can extend beyond ±100/±200.

Primary thresholds:
- CCI > +100: significantly above average — overbought OR start of strong trend; sustained >+100 = uptrend in progress, not necessarily a sell.
- CCI < -100: significantly below — oversold OR strong downtrend; sustained <-100 = downtrend in progress.
- Crossing above -100 from below = BUY (downside momentum weakening, returning to fair value).
- Crossing below +100 from above = SELL (upside momentum fading).

Zero-line: cross above 0 from below = early bullish shift (direction filter); below 0 from above = early bearish.

Trend persistence:
- Consistently >+100 multiple bars = strong uptrend; pullbacks toward +100 = buying opportunities, not sells.
- Consistently <-100 = strong downtrend.
- Bearish divergence: CCI lower highs while price higher highs → weakening → potential reversal.
- Bullish divergence: CCI higher lows while price lower lows → potential recovery.

Extremes: >+200 rare, extreme upside deviation — tends to eventually revert (timing unpredictable); <-200 extreme downside — may signal climax/panic selling.

Combinations:
- + RSI: both simultaneously OB or OS = confluence strengthens signal.
- + Bollinger: CCI>+100 near upper band = strong OB confluence; <-100 near lower band = OS.
- + MACD: CCI zero-cross same direction as MACD cross = early trend-shift confirmation.
- + Volume: CCI extreme + volume spike often marks reversals; surge at >+200 = climax buying.

Caveats: no fixed bounds — set no mechanical hard limits, context determines; in trends >+100 = strength not auto-sell; sensitive to 0.015 constant, readings frequently exceed ±300 on gaps/earnings; shorter periods (10–14) faster/noisier, longer (25–50) smoother/laggier.
