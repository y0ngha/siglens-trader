## Overview

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is computed as the difference between a short-period EMA and a long-period EMA, creating a momentum oscillator that also tracks trend direction. The standard settings are EMA(12), EMA(26), and a 9-period signal EMA. Three components drive analysis: the MACD line, the signal line, and the histogram.

## Signal Interpretation

### MACD Line vs. Signal Line Crossover

- MACD line crosses above signal line (Golden Cross): short-term momentum has turned bullish — a buy signal. Most reliable when the crossover occurs below the zero line and momentum is accelerating.
- MACD line crosses below signal line (Dead Cross): short-term momentum has turned bearish — a sell signal. Most reliable when the crossover occurs above the zero line.
- In choppy, ranging markets, crossover signals generate frequent false positives. Confirm with ADX or Bollinger Band width before acting.

### Histogram Analysis

- Histogram expanding positively (each bar taller than the last): bullish momentum is intensifying — trend continuation likely.
- Histogram shrinking from a positive peak: bullish momentum is weakening — prepare for potential reversal or pullback.
- Histogram expanding negatively: bearish momentum is intensifying.
- Histogram shrinking from a negative trough: bearish momentum is weakening — potential recovery.
- The histogram peak or trough often precedes the actual price reversal, giving it a leading indicator quality.

### Zero-Line Crossover

- MACD line crosses above zero: the short-period EMA is now above the long-period EMA — a medium-term bullish signal indicating structural trend shift.
- MACD line crosses below zero: the short-period EMA is now below the long-period EMA — a medium-term bearish signal.

### Divergence Signals

- Bearish divergence: price makes a higher high while MACD histogram or MACD line makes a lower high → momentum is weakening despite rising price — potential reversal.
- Bullish divergence: price makes a lower low while MACD histogram or MACD line makes a higher low → downside momentum is fading — potential recovery.
- MACD divergence is among the most reliable technical reversal signals. Best used at key support/resistance levels or near Bollinger Band extremes.

## Recommended Combinations

- MACD + EMA(20 or 60): Use EMA as a trend filter. Only take MACD buy signals when price is above EMA; sell signals when below.
- MACD + RSI: RSI confirms overbought/oversold context; MACD confirms the directional momentum shift.
- MACD + Bollinger Bands: MACD crossover within a Bollinger squeeze breakout is a high-probability trend initiation signal.
- MACD + ADX: When ADX > 25, MACD crossover signals gain reliability; when ADX < 20, treat MACD signals as low-confidence.

## Caveats

- MACD is a lagging indicator by nature. Do not rely on it for precise entry timing in fast-moving markets.
- In horizontal/ranging markets, signal-line crossovers occur frequently and are largely noise. Confirm market structure with ADX before using MACD signals.
- The 12/26/9 setting is optimized for daily bars. For intraday timeframes (1-minute, 5-minute), shorter settings (e.g., 6/12/5) may provide more responsive signals.

### MACD (12, 26, 9) — momentum oscillator + trend tracker

MACD line = EMA(12) − EMA(26); Signal = EMA(MACD, 9); Histogram = MACD − Signal.

Line vs Signal crossover:
- MACD crosses above Signal (Golden Cross) = bullish, buy signal; most reliable below the zero line with accelerating momentum.
- MACD crosses below Signal (Dead Cross) = bearish, sell signal; most reliable above the zero line.
- In choppy/ranging markets crossovers = frequent false positives; confirm with ADX or Bollinger width.

Histogram:
- Expanding positively (each bar taller) = bullish momentum intensifying, continuation likely.
- Shrinking from a positive peak = bullish momentum weakening, prepare for reversal/pullback.
- Expanding negatively = bearish intensifying.
- Shrinking from a negative trough = bearish weakening, potential recovery.
- Histogram peak/trough often precedes the price reversal (leading quality).

Zero-line: MACD above 0 = short EMA above long EMA, medium-term bullish (structural shift); below 0 = medium-term bearish.

Divergence: bearish = price higher high while MACD line/histogram lower high → momentum weakening, potential reversal. Bullish = price lower low while MACD higher low → downside momentum fading, potential recovery. Among the most reliable reversal signals — best at key S/R levels or Bollinger extremes.

Combinations: + EMA(20/60) trend filter (only take buys above EMA, sells below); + RSI (OB/OS context); + Bollinger (crossover within squeeze breakout = high-prob trend initiation); + ADX (ADX > 25 = reliable, ADX < 20 = low-confidence).

Caveats: lagging — don't rely on precise entry timing in fast markets. In horizontal/ranging markets signal-line crossovers = largely noise; confirm structure with ADX. 12/26/9 tuned for daily; intraday may use ~6/12/5.
