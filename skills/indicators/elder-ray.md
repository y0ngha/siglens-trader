## Overview

Elder-Ray was developed by Dr. Alexander Elder around 1989 and published in Trading for a Living (Wiley, 1993). The name evokes an X-ray of the buying and selling pressure beneath price.

- **Formula**: `Bull Power = High − EMA13`, `Bear Power = Low − EMA13`. The 13-period EMA is the "consensus of value"; the bar's high captures the maximum buyer power and the low the maximum seller power for that bar.
- **Normal regime**: Bull Power > 0 and Bear Power < 0. Their behavior *relative to that baseline* is the signal, not the raw level.

## Signal Interpretation

### Elder's Long Setup (the state gate)

Elder defined four conditions for a long; the core two drive the state gate:
1. The trend is up (EMA13 rising), and
2. **Bear Power is negative but rising** — sellers are losing grip. This "bear power turning up from below zero" is Elder's best buy setup. The mirror (Bull Power positive but falling in a downtrend) flags selling pressure entering a rally.
- The **state gate fires on these turn conditions** versus the previous bar.

### Divergence (the highest-quality variant)

- A bullish divergence (price lower low, Bear Power higher low) within an uptrend, or a bearish divergence (price higher high, Bull Power lower high), is Elder-Ray's strongest read — best used inside his Triple Screen system.

## Measured Reliability (신뢰도 가중치)

Confidence weight **0.45** — advisory only. Our forward-edge study found **0 of 18 cells significant** (all |t| < 1.8). The naive 0-cross was never the recommended signal (it generates false signals in ranges); Elder always embedded Elder-Ray inside the Triple Screen, conditioned on a higher-timeframe trend.

Reliability is best characterized as **moderate-to-high specifically for divergence within an established trend**, and low for any standalone level read.

## Recommended Combinations

- **Elder-Ray + EMA13 trend filter (Triple Screen)**: only act on bear-power-rising long setups when the higher-timeframe trend is up; only on bull-power-falling shorts when it is down.
- **Elder-Ray + price divergence at a key level**: a Bear Power higher-low against a price lower-low at support is the canonical high-quality buy.
- **Elder-Ray + a confirming oscillator (MACD / RSI) divergence**: agreement across two independent divergence reads raises confidence.

## Caveats

- Standalone forward edge measured at ≈0 — the raw 0-cross whipsaws in ranges.
- The signal is the *turn* (negative-but-rising / positive-but-falling), not the absolute sign; reading only "Bull > 0 = bullish" misuses the indicator.
- EMA13 is the anchor, so a fast EMA regime shift can briefly distort both powers — confirm the underlying trend with a separate filter.
