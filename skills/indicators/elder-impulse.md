## Overview

The Elder Impulse System was introduced by Dr. Alexander Elder in Come Into My Trading Room (Wiley, 2002). It colors each price bar by combining a trend read and a momentum read.

- **Formula (bar color)**: GREEN if EMA13 is rising AND the MACD histogram is rising; RED if both are falling; BLUE otherwise. MACD uses the standard (12,26,9).
- **Two-engine logic**: EMA13 captures trend (inertia), the MACD histogram captures momentum (the second derivative). A bar is only green/red when both agree.

## Signal Interpretation — Censorship / Permission

Elder's own framing is a **censorship rule**, not an entry rule: "It doesn't tell me what to do but rather what I'm *not allowed* to do."

- **GREEN** → longs are allowed; **shorting is forbidden.**
- **RED** → shorts are allowed; **buying is prohibited.**
- **BLUE** → both directions are permitted (momentum and trend disagree, so neither side is censored).
- The actionable moment is the **flip off a color** — green→blue, blue→red, etc. — because it changes *what is forbidden*. The **state gate fires when the latest bar carries a color and either flipped versus the previous colored bar or is non-blue** (green/red actively forbid one side). Elder's rule of thumb: "Enter cautiously, exit fast."

## Measured Reliability (신뢰도 가중치)

Confidence weight **0.45** — advisory / permission gate, not a standalone signal. Our forward-edge study found **0 of 18 cells significant** (all |t| < 1.8) — and this is the **strongest "working-as-designed" result** in the set. A censorship rule is *not supposed* to have a standalone forward edge: its value is the **conditional lift it adds to a separate entry method** (by suppressing counter-trend entries), not its own t-stat. Evaluating it by its own forward return is the wrong test.

As a **direction-permission gate it is moderate-to-high**; as a standalone signal it is low / not-applicable.

## Recommended Combinations

- **Elder Impulse + any entry method**: use the color to veto trades — never short on green, never buy on red. This is the intended use and where the conditional lift lives.
- **Elder Impulse + Bollinger %B event**: a daily %B overbought short is only permitted when the impulse is red or blue, never green.
- **Elder Impulse + regime lens**: the permission gate is most valuable in a clean trend (high R² / H > 0.5), where counter-trend entries are most punished.

## Caveats

- Do not score this indicator by its own forward return — it is a filter, evaluated by the lift it gives a separate entry, not by a standalone t-stat.
- Green/red is a *permission*, not a buy/sell command; acting on color alone over-trades.
- Because it combines EMA13 and the MACD histogram, it inherits both lags; the color can flip a bar or two after the underlying turn.

### Elder Impulse System Signal Guide
Censorship / permission gate, NOT an entry rule.
- Bar color: GREEN if EMA13 rising AND MACD histogram rising; RED if both falling; BLUE otherwise. MACD standard (12,26,9).

Censorship / permission (Elder: "tells me what I'm NOT allowed to do"):
- GREEN → longs allowed; shorting FORBIDDEN.
- RED → shorts allowed; buying PROHIBITED.
- BLUE → both directions permitted (momentum and trend disagree, neither side censored).
- Actionable moment = the flip off a color (green→blue, blue→red, etc.) — it changes what is forbidden. State gate fires when the latest bar carries a color and either flipped vs the previous colored bar or is non-blue (green/red actively forbid one side). Elder: "Enter cautiously, exit fast."

Reliability: confidence weight 0.45 (advisory / permission gate, not standalone). Forward-edge: 0 of 18 cells significant (all |t|<1.8) — the strongest "working-as-designed" result in the set. A censorship rule is not supposed to have a standalone edge; its value is the conditional LIFT it adds to a separate entry method (suppressing counter-trend entries). As a direction-permission gate: moderate-to-high; as a standalone signal: low / not-applicable.

Combinations:
- + any entry method: use color to VETO — never short on green, never buy on red (where the conditional lift lives).
- + Bollinger %B event: a daily %B overbought short is only permitted when impulse is red or blue, never green.
- + regime lens: most valuable in a clean trend (high R² / H>0.5), where counter-trend entries are most punished.

Caveats: do not score by its own forward return (it's a filter, evaluated by lift not standalone t-stat); green/red is a permission not a buy/sell command (acting on color alone over-trades); inherits EMA13 + MACD-histogram lags (color can flip a bar or two after the underlying turn).
