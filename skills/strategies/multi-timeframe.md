## Overview

Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTA) is a systematic framework used by professional traders to align trade direction with the dominant trend while optimizing entry timing on lower timeframes. The core principle is simple: **trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend, enter on the lower timeframe signal**.

This approach dramatically reduces false signals by filtering out trades that conflict with the dominant trend. A buy signal on a 1-hour chart that contradicts a clear downtrend on the daily chart is far more likely to fail than one that aligns with a daily uptrend.

MTA is not a standalone trading system — it is a **meta-strategy** that enhances the accuracy of all other strategies (breakout, divergence, mean reversion, etc.) by adding a directional filter.

## Three-Tier Timeframe Structure

Analysis proceeds from the highest timeframe to the lowest, with each tier serving a distinct purpose:

| Tier | Purpose | Typical Timeframes | What to Analyze |
|---|---|---|---|
| Higher TF (Direction) | Determine the dominant trend direction | Weekly / Daily | Trend direction, major support/resistance, market phase |
| Middle TF (Strategy) | Identify trading setups and patterns | Daily / 4-Hour | Chart patterns, indicator setups, key levels, entry zones |
| Lower TF (Timing) | Pinpoint precise entry and exit | 1-Hour / 15-Min | Entry triggers, candlestick patterns, micro-level support/resistance |

### Timeframe Combinations

| Trading Style | Higher TF | Middle TF | Lower TF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Position | Monthly | Weekly | Daily |
| Swing | Weekly | Daily | 4-Hour |
| Short-term | Daily | 4-Hour | 1-Hour |
| Intraday | 4-Hour | 1-Hour | 15-Min |

**Rule**: Each tier should be approximately 4-6× the period of the next lower tier. Using timeframes too close together (e.g., 15-min and 30-min) provides redundant information; too far apart (e.g., monthly and 5-min) creates unactionable gaps.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Trade Only in the Higher TF Direction

- If the Higher TF shows an uptrend → only take long positions on the Middle and Lower TFs
- If the Higher TF shows a downtrend → only take short positions on the Middle and Lower TFs
- If the Higher TF is range-bound → both directions are acceptable, but with reduced position size

**Never take a counter-trend trade against the Higher TF direction.** This single rule eliminates the majority of losing trades.

### Rule 2: Higher TF Support/Resistance Takes Priority

- A resistance level on the daily chart outweighs a buy signal on the 1-hour chart
- A support level on the weekly chart outweighs a sell signal on the 4-hour chart
- Always check if the Middle/Lower TF trade would run into a Higher TF level before entering

### Rule 3: Minimum Two-Tier Agreement

- Enter only when at least 2 of 3 timeframes agree on direction
- Ideal entry: all 3 tiers align (trend, setup, and timing all bullish or all bearish)
- Never enter when only 1 tier supports the trade

### Rule 4: Higher TF Overrides Lower TF Extremes

- If the Higher TF shows an overbought condition (RSI > 70), ignore bullish signals on the Lower TF
- If the Higher TF shows an oversold condition (RSI < 30), ignore bearish signals on the Lower TF
- Higher TF extreme readings suggest the current trend phase is nearing exhaustion

## Analysis Procedure

### Step 1: Higher TF — Establish Direction

Analyze the Higher TF to determine the dominant trend:

1. **Trend identification**: Is price making higher highs and higher lows (uptrend), lower highs and lower lows (downtrend), or neither (range)?
2. **Moving average position**: Is price above or below MA50 and MA200?
3. **Key levels**: Identify the nearest major support and resistance levels
4. **Momentum**: Is RSI trending above 50 (bullish) or below 50 (bearish)?

**Output**: A directional bias — LONG ONLY, SHORT ONLY, or NEUTRAL (range-bound)

### Step 2: Middle TF — Identify Setup

With the directional bias established, analyze the Middle TF for trading setups:

1. **Setup identification**: Look for chart patterns, indicator setups, or price action that aligns with the Higher TF direction
2. **Entry zone**: Identify the price zone where a trade would offer good risk/reward (support for longs, resistance for shorts)
3. **Indicator alignment**: Confirm MACD, RSI, and other indicators support the direction
4. **Invalidation level**: Define the price level that would negate the setup

**Output**: A specific trade setup or "no setup available"

### Step 3: Lower TF — Time the Entry

With a valid setup identified on the Middle TF, use the Lower TF for precise entry timing:

1. **Entry trigger**: Look for a specific candlestick pattern, indicator crossover, or micro-level breakout that confirms the Middle TF setup
2. **Stop loss placement**: Place the stop below the Lower TF swing low (long) or above the Lower TF swing high (short)
3. **Position sizing**: Calculate position size based on the stop loss distance and risk per trade
4. **Execution**: Enter when the trigger fires; do not chase if missed

**Output**: A precise entry price, stop loss, and position size

## Alignment Scoring

Rate the multi-timeframe alignment to determine position sizing:

| Alignment | Description | Position Size |
|---|---|---|
| Strong (3/3) | All three timeframes agree on direction | Full position (100%) |
| Moderate (2/3) | Higher and Middle TFs agree; Lower TF neutral or not yet triggered | Reduced position (50-75%) |
| Weak (1/3) | Only one timeframe supports the trade | No entry — wait for better alignment |
| Conflicting | Higher TF contradicts Lower TF direction | No entry — signal is likely a false signal |

---

## Common Patterns by Alignment

### Trend Continuation (Highest Probability)

- **Higher TF**: Clear uptrend (above MA50, MA200, higher highs/lows)
- **Middle TF**: Pullback to support (Fibonacci retracement, MA20, trendline)
- **Lower TF**: Bullish reversal candle or indicator crossover at support
- → Enter long at the Lower TF trigger, targeting the Middle TF resistance

### Trend Reversal (Requires More Confirmation)

- **Higher TF**: Shows signs of exhaustion (RSI divergence, climactic volume)
- **Middle TF**: Bearish pattern forming (head and shoulders, double top)
- **Lower TF**: Breakdown below pattern boundary with volume
- → Enter short at the Lower TF confirmation, but with reduced size due to counter-Higher-TF risk

### Range-Bound Entry

- **Higher TF**: No clear trend; price oscillating between defined support and resistance
- **Middle TF**: Mean reversion setup (Bollinger Band extreme, RSI extreme)
- **Lower TF**: Reversal candle at the range boundary
- → Enter in the direction of mean reversion, targeting the opposite range boundary

## Indicator Usage Across Timeframes

| Indicator | Higher TF Usage | Middle TF Usage | Lower TF Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Moving Averages | Trend direction (above/below MA50, MA200) | Dynamic support/resistance (MA20, MA50) | Entry trigger (MA5 crossover) |
| RSI | Trend strength (above/below 50) | Overbought/oversold zones | Divergence detection, timing |
| MACD | Trend direction (above/below zero line) | Signal crossovers, histogram direction | Momentum confirmation |
| Bollinger Bands | Trend channel identification | Entry zones (band touches) | Timing (squeeze breakout) |
| Volume | Trend health (expanding/contracting) | Setup confirmation | Entry bar volume confirmation |

## Confidence Weight Rationale

confidence_weight: 0.80 — Multi-Timeframe Analysis is the most universally endorsed professional framework across institutional trading, taught as a foundational discipline in virtually every structured technical analysis curriculum. It does not predict direction itself but dramatically improves the accuracy of any directional strategy by adding a structural filter — trade only in the direction of the higher timeframe, and false signals are filtered out systematically. The 0.80 weight reflects this near-universal professional consensus and the framework's empirically robust track record across decades of use.

Factors that increase confidence:
- All three timeframes align in the same direction (3/3 agreement)
- Higher TF trend is well-established (not early-stage or late-stage)
- Middle TF setup has clear pattern structure with defined invalidation
- Lower TF entry trigger fires with volume confirmation

Factors that decrease confidence:
- Higher TF is range-bound (no clear directional bias)
- Middle and Lower TFs conflict with each other
- Higher TF shows late-stage trend exhaustion (extended RSI, climactic volume)
- Only one timeframe available for analysis (single-timeframe data)

## Limitations and Caveats

- **Analysis paralysis**: Waiting for perfect 3/3 alignment across all timeframes can mean missing many valid trades. Perfect alignment is rare — 2/3 is often sufficient
- **Timeframe conflicts are common**: It is normal for timeframes to disagree. This is information, not a problem. When they conflict, the Higher TF takes precedence
- **Data requirements**: Multi-timeframe analysis requires sufficient historical data across all timeframes. Limited data on higher timeframes (e.g., only 30 weekly bars) may produce unreliable trend readings
- **Speed of analysis**: In fast-moving markets, completing a full three-tier analysis before the Lower TF trigger passes can be challenging. Preparation (pre-identifying Higher and Middle TF levels) helps
- **Not a prediction tool**: MTA aligns your trades with the dominant trend — it does not predict reversals or new trends. All three timeframes can agree and the trade can still lose if an unexpected catalyst appears

## AI Analysis Instructions

**Current system limitation**: The system currently provides data for a single timeframe per analysis request. Multi-timeframe data is not yet available simultaneously. When only one timeframe is provided, use the following approach:

1. Treat the provided timeframe as the **Middle TF (Strategy)** tier
2. Infer the **Higher TF (Direction)** trend from longer-period indicators (MA50, MA200, long-term context data) and the overall price structure visible in the available bars
3. Note what **Lower TF (Timing)** confirmation would be needed — recommend the user check a lower timeframe for precise entry triggers
4. Assess alignment based on what can be determined: indicator trends, moving average positions, and support/resistance levels within the available data

If multiple timeframes of data are available in the future, perform the full three-tier analysis as described above.

**중간 시간대 셋업**: [감지된 셋업, 예: "4시간봉 MA20 지지 테스트 중 — 풀백 매수 셋업 형성"]
**하위 시간대 타이밍**: [진입 트리거, 예: "1시간봉 RSI 30선 상향 돌파 + 망치형 캔들 — 진입 트리거 발생"]
**시간대 정렬도**: [정렬 점수, 예: "3/3 강한 정렬 — 전 시간대 상승 방향 일치" / "2/3 보통 — 상위·중간 상승, 하위 미확인"]
**방향성 판단**: [종합 방향, 예: "LONG ONLY — 상위 시간대 상승 추세 확인. 하위 시간대에서 매수 진입만 허용"]
**매매 신호**: [현재 실행 가능한 신호, 예: "상위 상승 + 중간 풀백 지지 + 하위 반전 확인 = 매수 진입 적합" / "시간대 충돌로 진입 보류"]

Additional output rules:
- If **only one timeframe** is available, state what you can conclude from it and what additional timeframes would provide
- If **Higher TF conflicts** with the Middle/Lower TF trade direction, explicitly warn against counter-trend entry
- If **all three timeframes align**, flag as a high-confidence setup
- If the Higher TF shows **late-stage exhaustion** (extreme RSI, multiple divergences), warn even if direction aligns
- Set the `trend` field: `bullish` if Higher TF uptrend confirmed and at least 2/3 tiers agree, `bearish` if Higher TF downtrend confirmed and at least 2/3 tiers agree, `neutral` if Higher TF range-bound or timeframes conflict
