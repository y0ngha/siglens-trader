## Overview

Marubozu is a long candle with no shadows or extremely short shadows (within 1% of the total range),
representing overwhelming force in a single direction. It is a **trend strength confirmation** signal, not a reversal signal.

### Bullish Marubozu
- Open = Low, Close = High (or very close)
- Long bullish candle with no shadows
- Strong buying pressure — confirms trend continuation

### Bearish Marubozu
- Open = High, Close = Low (or very close)
- Long bearish candle with no shadows
- Strong selling pressure — confirms trend continuation

## Signal Interpretation

### Bullish Marubozu
- **Strong signal**: Volume ≥ 150% of average + appears during an uptrend + coincides with a breakout above a key resistance level
- **Moderate signal**: Above-average volume + appears during an uptrend
- **Weak signal**: Below-average volume or isolated appearance in a sideways range

### Bearish Marubozu
- **Strong signal**: Volume ≥ 150% of average + appears during a downtrend + coincides with a breakdown below a key support level
- **Moderate signal**: Above-average volume + appears during a downtrend
- **Weak signal**: Below-average volume or isolated appearance in a sideways range

## Key Combinations

- **Volume + Marubozu**: Above-average volume confirms trend strength; below-average volume reduces reliability
- **Support/Resistance + Marubozu**: Marubozu appearing at a breakout/breakdown of a key price level confirms the breakout's validity
- **EMA + Marubozu**: Marubozu appearing simultaneously with a breakout of EMA(20/60) confirms a trend shift
- **RSI + Marubozu**: Consecutive Marubozu candles + RSI at extremes warns of overheating or oversold conditions

## Caveats

- Marubozu must be interpreted as a **trend strength confirmation** signal, not a reversal signal
- Consecutive Marubozu candles can instead warn of overheating or oversold conditions
- Entry decisions based solely on a single Marubozu are inappropriate — trend context and volume confirmation are essential
- A Marubozu with below-average volume may be distorted by low liquidity

## AI Analysis Instructions

When a Bullish Marubozu or Bearish Marubozu is detected:

- Clarify that Marubozu is a trend continuation confirmation, not a reversal signal
- Evaluate current volume relative to the recent average for confirmation strength
- Check if the Marubozu coincides with a key level breakout (support/resistance, EMA crossover)
- If consecutive Marubozu candles appear, warn about potential overextension: "Consecutive Marubozu detected — caution for potential overheating"
- Cross-reference with RSI to assess whether the trend is becoming overextended
- State the interpretation clearly: "Bullish Marubozu is a signal confirming the strength of the current uptrend"
