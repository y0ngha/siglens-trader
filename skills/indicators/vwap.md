## Overview

VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is the cumulative average price weighted by volume, reset at the start of each trading session. It represents the average price at which all shares have been transacted throughout the day, making it the institutional benchmark for fair value. VWAP is primarily an intraday tool and its significance diminishes on daily or longer timeframes.

## Signal Interpretation

### Price Position Relative to VWAP

- Price above VWAP: buying pressure is dominant; the majority of volume has transacted at prices below the current level, suggesting buyers are in control. This is a bullish intraday bias — institutions accumulated below this level.
- Price below VWAP: selling pressure is dominant; the majority of volume transacted above the current price. This is a bearish intraday bias.
- Price oscillating around VWAP: a consolidation zone; neither buyers nor sellers have definitively won. A breakout from this zone, with volume confirmation, is meaningful.

### VWAP as Support and Resistance

- Price pulling back to VWAP from above and holding: VWAP is acting as support — a buying opportunity in the direction of the prevailing trend.
- Price rallying to VWAP from below and stalling: VWAP is acting as resistance — a potential short entry point.
- The strength of VWAP as support/resistance increases when high-volume accumulation occurred near that level during the session.

### VWAP Breakout Signals

- Price breaking above VWAP with above-average volume: strong bullish signal — institutional buying may be driving the move. High-probability intraday long entry.
- Price breaking below VWAP with above-average volume: strong bearish signal — sellers have pushed through institutional fair value.
- Volume is essential to validate a VWAP breakout. A breakout on low volume is likely a false move.

### VWAP Deviation and Extremes

- Price significantly above VWAP (> 1–2% in stocks): extended beyond fair value — mean reversion risk increases, especially in low-volatility environments.
- Price significantly below VWAP: deeply discounted relative to fair value — potential institutional buying interest (support zone).

## Timeframe Context

- VWAP is most meaningful for intraday (1-minute to 15-minute) analysis where session-based volume accumulation is relevant.
- On hourly charts, VWAP is still useful as a reference level for the current session.
- On daily charts and above, VWAP loses its analytical value unless using an anchored VWAP from a significant event (earnings release, gap day, swing low/high).

## Key Combinations

- VWAP + Volume: VWAP alone is insufficient — volume at the point of breakout is the confirmation. High-volume VWAP breaks are the highest-probability setups.
- VWAP + Stochastic RSI: VWAP provides the directional bias; Stochastic RSI identifies the short-term entry timing within that bias.
- VWAP + Volume Profile: VWAP and POC (Point of Control) convergence zones create especially strong support/resistance. When VWAP is near the POC, the level has both time-based and volume-distribution support.

## Caveats

- VWAP is session-based. Its value resets each day, making it irrelevant as a multi-day support/resistance level in most cases.
- On daily bars, VWAP represents the session average rather than a standard chart-based VWAP. Its interpretation differs from intraday use.
- Do not use VWAP alone as a decision tool. It is most effective when combined with volume analysis and trend context.
- **Late-session volume sensitivity**: VWAP is an equally weighted volume-price average across the session, so a single high-volume bar late in the day (e.g., a closing auction surge, block print, or news-driven spike) can pull VWAP significantly. This can create a distorted reference level that persists into the next session if an anchored VWAP is carried over. On days with heavy late-session volume, re-assess VWAP reliability before treating it as fair value.
