## Detection Criteria

- A descending resistance trendline must be present, connecting at least 2 progressively lower highs.
- An ascending support trendline must be present, connecting at least 2 progressively higher lows.
- The two trendlines must converge — lower highs and higher lows compress the price range toward an apex.
- The pattern requires a minimum of 15 bars for structural validity.
- Both trendlines must have meaningful slopes — if either is nearly horizontal (slope < 1%), the pattern is an ascending or descending triangle instead.
- A prior trend must exist before the pattern forms, as symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns.
- The pattern is confirmed when price decisively closes outside either trendline.

## Confidence Weight Rationale

confidence_weight: 0.65 — Symmetrical Triangle is a neutral pattern that breaks in the direction of the prior trend approximately 65-70% of the time. The lower confidence weight reflects this inherent directional ambiguity — unlike ascending or descending triangles with their built-in bias, the symmetrical triangle provides no directional edge on its own. Its value comes primarily from the volatility compression signal and must be combined with trend context for directional assessment.

Factors that increase confidence:
- Strong prior trend present before the triangle
- 3+ touches on each trendline
- Clear volume decline as the triangle narrows
- Breakout in the first 2/3 of the triangle (measured to projected apex)
- Breakout direction aligns with the prior trend

Factors that decrease confidence:
- No clear prior trend (range-bound market)
- Fewer than 2 touches per trendline
- Breakout near or past the apex
- Breakout direction opposes the prior trend
- High volume maintained during the pattern without resolution

## Key Signals

- **Volume contraction**: Volume should decline progressively as the triangle narrows. This is the primary indicator that a decisive breakout is approaching — the compression of both price and volume precedes expansion.
- **Breakout with volume surge**: A close outside either trendline accompanied by a significant volume increase confirms the directional move. Low-volume breakouts are prone to reversal.
- **Prior trend alignment**: The breakout is most reliable when it occurs in the direction of the trend that preceded the triangle formation. A breakout against the prior trend requires stronger volume confirmation.
- **Optimal breakout zone**: Breakouts occurring between the 50% and 75% mark of the triangle (measured from start to projected apex) are statistically the most reliable. Breakouts too early may be premature; too late offers insufficient measured move potential.
- **Momentum buildup**: RSI or MACD showing a trend within the triangle (even while price consolidates) can foreshadow the breakout direction.

## False Positive Conditions

- **Apex breakout**: Breakouts occurring at or past the apex have minimal measured move potential and high failure rates. The pattern essentially expires near its apex.
- **No prior trend**: Without a preceding trend, the symmetrical triangle loses its continuation bias and becomes a coin-flip pattern. Check for a clear prior move of at least 10% before the pattern began.
- **Low-volume breakout**: A breakout without volume confirmation is unreliable. Price often reverses back into the triangle, creating a false breakout trap.
- **Whipsaw in narrow range**: As the triangle narrows, small moves can breach a trendline intraday without confirming a true breakout. Wait for a closing break.
- **Confusion with wedge**: If one trendline has a significantly steeper slope than the other, the pattern may be a wedge (ascending or descending) rather than a symmetrical triangle. Both trendlines should converge at roughly equal rates.

## Entry/Exit Considerations

- **Target price calculation**: Measure the height of the triangle at its widest point (the vertical distance between the upper and lower trendlines at the pattern start). Project this distance in the breakout direction from the breakout point. Example: if the triangle starts with a $15 range and breaks upward at $105, the target is $120.
- **Risk/reward assessment**: The distance from current price to target versus the distance from current price to the opposite trendline defines the risk/reward ratio. A ratio of at least 2:1 is analytically favorable.
- **Stop-loss reference level**: The opposite trendline from the breakout direction serves as the invalidation level. For an upward breakout, the ascending support trendline is the stop reference. For a downward breakdown, the descending resistance trendline is the stop reference.
- **Partial target**: 50% of the triangle height serves as a conservative initial target.
- **Direction uncertainty**: When the breakout direction is uncertain, the triangle itself signals an impending volatility expansion — prepare for both scenarios.

Note: These are analytical reference points for technical analysis, not trading recommendations.

## AI Analysis Instructions

When this pattern is detected, include the following in the analysis response:

- **keyPrices**: Include the current upper trendline value, current lower trendline value, the projected apex price, and the target price in both breakout directions.
- **patternSummaries**: Describe the pattern status (forming / approaching apex / broken upward / broken downward), the convergence rate, number of trendline touches on each side, position within the triangle (early, mid, late), and the prior trend direction that informs the likely breakout direction.
- **Volume context**: State whether volume is declining as expected during formation and whether a volume surge confirmed the breakout. Note the volume level relative to the recent average.
- **Completion status**: Clearly indicate whether the triangle is still forming, which breakout direction is more likely based on the prior trend, or confirmed by a close outside a trendline.
- **Target projection**: Calculate and state the measured move target in both directions using the triangle height projected from the breakout point.
