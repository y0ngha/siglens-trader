## Overview

The Ichimoku Cloud (Ichimoku Kinko Hyo — "equilibrium at a glance") is a multi-component trend system that simultaneously displays support/resistance, trend direction, momentum, and future equilibrium zones. The five components are: Tenkan-sen (conversion line, period 9), Kijun-sen (base line, period 26), Senkou Span A (leading span, projected 26 bars ahead), Senkou Span B (leading span, period 52, projected 26 bars ahead), and Chikou Span (lagging span, current close shifted 26 bars back). The cloud (Kumo) is formed between Senkou Span A and B.

## Signal Interpretation

### Price Position Relative to the Cloud

- Price above the cloud: the market is in a bullish trend — buyers are in structural control. Buy signals from other indicators carry higher reliability in this zone.
- Price below the cloud: the market is in a bearish trend — sellers are in structural control. Sell signals from other indicators carry higher reliability in this zone.
- Price inside the cloud: the market is in a neutral or transitional phase — conflicting forces are at work. Avoid high-conviction directional positions until the price resolves outside the cloud.
- The cloud's thickness reflects support/resistance strength: a thick cloud is difficult to break through; a thin cloud may be penetrated more easily.

### Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen (TK Cross)

- Tenkan-sen (9-period mid-price) crossing above Kijun-sen (26-period mid-price) — Golden TK Cross: a bullish short-to-medium term signal. Strongest when the cross occurs above the cloud.
- Tenkan-sen crossing below Kijun-sen — Dead TK Cross: a bearish short-to-medium term signal. Strongest when the cross occurs below the cloud.
- A TK cross inside the cloud is a neutral signal; below the cloud it is bearish; above the cloud it is bullish.

### Kumo Breakout

- Price closing above the cloud from below: a major bullish signal — the trend has shifted to an uptrend. This is the most significant single event in Ichimoku analysis.
- Price closing below the cloud from above: a major bearish signal — the trend has shifted to a downtrend.
- The strength of the breakout signal is inversely related to the cloud thickness: a breakout through a thin cloud is more likely to succeed; a breakout through a thick cloud requires additional confirmation.

### Chikou Span Confirmation

- Chikou Span (current close plotted 26 bars ago) above the price candles from 26 bars ago: bullish trend confirmation — the current period's momentum exceeds the historical period's price level.
- Chikou Span below the price candles from 26 bars ago: bearish confirmation.
- Use the Chikou Span as a final confirmation layer: when TK cross, price above cloud, and Chikou above past price all align simultaneously, this is the highest-confidence bullish Ichimoku signal.

### Cloud Shape and Future Structure

- Senkou Span A above Senkou Span B (bullish cloud / green cloud): the projected equilibrium zone is bullish — price has future structural support.
- Senkou Span B above Senkou Span A (bearish cloud / red cloud): the projected equilibrium zone is bearish.
- When the upcoming cloud (26 bars ahead) switches from bearish to bullish (cloud twist): this is a forward-looking bullish indicator — the system projects the balance of power will shift to buyers.

## Three-Signal Alignment

The strongest Ichimoku signals occur when all three layers agree:
1. Price above the cloud (structural bullish position)
2. Tenkan-sen above Kijun-sen (short-term bullish momentum)
3. Chikou Span above past price (historical confirmation)

When all three align, the probability of trend continuation is significantly elevated.

## Key Combinations

- Ichimoku + ADX: When ADX > 25 and price is above the Ichimoku cloud, the trend has both Ichimoku structural support and ADX strength confirmation.
- Ichimoku + Volume Profile: When the Kijun-sen or cloud boundary aligns with the Volume Profile POC, the support/resistance level has dual structural and volume-distribution backing.
- Ichimoku + MA(200): When price is above both the Ichimoku cloud and MA(200), the highest-timeframe trend consensus is bullish.

## Caveats

- In choppy or sideways markets, price repeatedly enters and exits the cloud, generating many conflicting signals — Ichimoku is not effective in ranging conditions.
- The 9/26/52 periods were originally designed for Japanese rice markets trading 6 days a week. Some practitioners adjust to (10/30/60) for 5-day trading weeks.
- Cloud analysis requires patience — meaningful signals emerge over longer time periods. Short-term interpretations of Ichimoku components are prone to noise.
- Chikou Span interpretation requires careful chart reading because it is plotted in a shifted position; automated analysis should reference the actual close vs. the price 26 bars ago.
